## Part 1: Test Plan
### Subject: https://www.belk.com/p/madison-slim-fit-dynamic-cooling-stretch-dress-shirt/320164011M0070.html?dwvar_320164011M0070_color=050330628212#start=1

https://www.belk.com/ is online shopping website for the department store, Belk. I discovered this site while randomly shopping online one day and thought it would make a good subject for a test plan since it had noticable bugs. This test plan applies to pretty much any product page on https://www.belk.com/, but I used a specific example to make testing easier to follow.

### Test Feature: Product Image Zoom
- When hovering over an image, a zoom window appears to the right of the image with a magnified view of the image: ![zoom-on-hover](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54592360/194744557-5ef71775-0304-47f2-b794-3ecacbb6eeff.gif)
- When clicking on an image, a zoom popup box appears in the center of page: ![zoom-on-click](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54592360/194744586-873dd11c-29b6-423e-815c-7ebb1e8aabc3.gif)

Test cases:

### 1. Hover over photo pull ups a zoom window to the right with the photo magnified

### 2. Clicking on photo pulls up a dialog box that has the photo magnified

### 3. Bug: Flashing zoom window when hover on and off of photo (see video)
